# The I don't really care license

This license lets you do anything you want with this code.

You can:
- Keep this license, or use a different one
- Use this for commercial use
- You can choose to release the source code if modified, would be cool if you did
- Link back to the original repo if you've made changes

You can't:
- Claim that the program was yours
- Keep the same name as the original author when forking

Pretty simple right?

# Install
Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/KotonBads/pyfetch.git
```
Either copy `pyfetch.py` to `$PATH` or make a symlink to it
```
ln /path/to/pyfetch.py/ ~/local/bin
cp /path/to/pyfetch.py/ ~/local/bin
```
or wherever you want to install it

# Configuration
Since this is written in Python, this is easily hackable and can be modified to your liking. I might add a configuration file sooner or later depending if enough people actually want it.
